        <h2>ABOUT</h2>
        <p>A family is a group of people related by the ties of blood, marriage, or adoption. Members of a family most often live in a single residence and perform different duties. Members of a family and their duties vary from culture to culture and at different times in history. Who is considered a family member, and what responsibilities that family member has, may depend on their age, sex, and relationship to other family members.</p>

        <p>A family may be led by either a man or a woman. A patriarchal family is one run by the father or eldest male of a household. He usually decides the duties of the women and children in the family. Traditionally in Nigeria, the eldest male is the patriarch, or leader, of the extended family. In this role, the patriarch solves family disputes and divides the familys wealth. The patriarch is also the spiritual leader of the family because he is thought to be the closest to the spirits of the familys ancestors.</p>
